## Black Friday Sales Prediction

### Project Introduction

Black Friday is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the United States, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. It marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season, with many stores offering highly promoted sales. As a retail store or eCommerce business, maximizing profits during this period is crucial. Our project aims to predict product prices based on historical Black Friday sales data, helping retailers make informed pricing decisions.

### Dataset Description

- The dataset is sourced from an online data analytics hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya.
- It contains features such as age, gender, marital status, product categories purchased, city demographics, and purchase amounts.
- The dataset consists of 12 columns and 537,577 records.
- Our model will predict the purchase amount of products.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here are some key observations from our data visualization:

1. **Gender Influence:**
   - Approximately 75% of purchases are made by male users, while the remaining 25% are made by female users.
   - On average, male consumers spend more than female consumers.

2. **Marital Status Impact:**
   - Single men spend the most during Black Friday.
   - Married men tend to spend less, possibly due to added responsibilities.

3. **Age Group Insights:**
   - Consumers aged 25-40 contribute the most to sales.

4. **City and Stay Duration:**
   - People who have spent 1 year in a city tend to spend the most.
   - Long-term residents (more than 4 years) show less interest in buying new things.

5. **City-Specific Purchases:**
   - Although City B generates the highest overall sales income, the specific product we're analyzing is predominantly purchased in City C.

### Modeling Phase

- We'll use regression machine learning algorithms to predict product prices.
- Features like age, gender, marital status, and product categories will be used for modeling.

### Evaluation Metric

- Our model's performance will be evaluated using relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

### Conclusion

The Black Friday Sales Prediction project empowers retailers to optimize pricing strategies, maximize profits, and enhance customer experiences during this critical shopping season. üéÅ
